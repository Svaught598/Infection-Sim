# Infection Simulator

An simulation using molecular dynamics to model infectious spread among small populations.

## Motivation

At the start of the pandemic, I was taking a computational physics course. Our instructor emailed the class a link to a COVID-19 simulation that implemented molecular dynamics to model spread. This project was undertaken to try and replicate their results with my own simulation. The Physics isn't exactly comprehensive (energy is not conserved, collisions aren't elastic, no molecular attractive/repulsive forces, etc...) because those characteristics were not present in the original simulation.
